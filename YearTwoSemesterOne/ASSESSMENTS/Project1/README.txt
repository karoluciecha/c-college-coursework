Dear User,

Two things:

1.
In order to comply with Moodle's file size limitations, the screencast is attached in very low quality.
To check out the full-resolution one, please follow this link to an unlisted video on YouTube:

2.
All code is saved in the main.c file.
highLeaderboard.txt file is attached to provide scores for the Top Scores Leaderboard, however it is not an essential file to the program.

Thank you for reading.
